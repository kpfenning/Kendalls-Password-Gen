# Kendalls-Password-Gen

This webpage is used to generate random passwords. It will generate a password that is between 8-128 character with options to include numbers, upper and/or lower case letters, and special characters. 

## Description 

When a user goes to this webpage they will find a generate password button. Once clicked, they will be prompted to enter how many characters they want their password to be. It will only allow the user to enter numbers that are betwen 8-128. If the user enters a number or letter(s) that are not within that scope, they will be prompted to try again. Once the user correctly inputs how many characters they would like their password to be, it will then ask if they would like lowercase characters in their password. Then it will ask if they want uppercase characters, then if they want special characters, and lastly if they want numbers in their password. Based on the users selections of the type of characters they want their password to be, the webpage will randomly generate a password with the users preferred characters. If the user selects Cancel on any of the prompts, those characters will not be included in the password that is generated. And BOOM, new randomly generated password!

Below you will find a screenshot of the Password Generator webpage!
